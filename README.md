# MIPS-Processor-Implementation
This project aims to design a 16-bit MIPS-like processor using Logisim simulator. The processor features a simple instruction set architecture with R-type, I-type, and J-type instruction formats. It includes seven general-purpose registers and a program counter. The goal is to model and test the processor's functionality.
